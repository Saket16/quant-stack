## Executive Summary
We recommend a **BUY** on Costco (COST) with a 3–5 year horizon.  
Target price: ~$650 (implying ~14% upside).  

**Thesis highlights:**
1. **Membership model moat** — Costco’s ~94% renewal rate locks in recurring revenue and creates sticky customer relationships.  
2. **Scale + private label** — Kirkland Signature drives higher margins and customer loyalty.  
3. **Balance sheet strength** — virtually no net debt, ample cash flows to support dividends and growth.  

**Key risks:**
- Margin pressure from food inflation.  
- Competition from Amazon/Walmart.  
- Membership attrition in a downturn.
